# Leetcode-solutions
Welcome to my personal collection of **LeetCode problem solutions**, organized by difficulty level and topic. 

I primarily solve problems using **Java**, which not only helps in writing clean and efficient code but also strengthens my understanding of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism through real-world problem-solving.

I also use **Python** occasionally, especially for quick prototyping or exploring different algorithmic approaches.

## 🧠 Why Java?

- Java’s **strong OOP foundation** makes it ideal for building scalable and modular solutions.
- Solving problems in Java helps improve **algorithmic thinking** while reinforcing **software design principles**.
- Writing in Java encourages **clear structure** and **type safety**, both crucial for technical interviews and professional development.
